# Js Net is an open source terminal program for executing web page shortcuts

## Remember to run `npm install` to install the dependencies
```

## If you want to add more shortcuts enter into `assets/routes.json` and modify the json file, this is the default file:

```json
{
    "Udemy": "https://www.udemy.com/",
    "Youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/?hl=es-419&gl=MX",
    "FreeCodeCamp": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/",
    "CodeCademy": "https://www.codecademy.com/"
}
```

## If you want to run the jsdoc file run the next command:

```
npm run-script docs
```

## This command will generate the documentation on `docs/`
